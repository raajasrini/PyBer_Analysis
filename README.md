# PyBer Analysis.

## Overview :

The assignment is to analyze the byber ride data to find the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types to showcase the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 

To showcase analysis of the total weekly fares for each city type in multiple-line graph and provides summarized view of the data differs by city type and those differences to take strategic decisions.
  
## Results :

 #### PyBer  Analysis  Results  :

  
* The  [bubble chart]()  showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.

* The [mean, median, and mode]() would be helpfull to analyze the **total number of rides for each city type , the average fares for each city type and the total number of drivers for each city type**.

* The [box-and-whisker plots]() helps to visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
 * The number of rides for each city type.
 * The fares for each city type.
 * The number of drivers for each city type.

* A pie chart [% of total rides by city type]() and [% of total drivers by city type]() that visualizes the percent of total fares , total rides and the total drivers. 
 * You can observe that urban make up for 62.7% and 68.4% of total fare and rides. This could be a possible of an over supply of drivers in these areas causing lower prices.
 * A similar but less usual trend in suburban areas.

* The [pyber summary view]() provides the fare per ride and driver per ride in the city.
  * There is no well defined trend in average fare per ride ($34.62) and drivers($55.49) in rural areas.
  * The total fare in Urban areas are in the range of from $1500 to $2500 and increasing trend from Jan but drops in March to April. 
  * The total fare in Suburban areas are in the range of above $500 and below $1500. Steady trend from Jan and pikes in Feb to March month.
  * Rural area total fare is in the below $500 range but seems ups and downs in Feb to April.

##  Summary : 

   The byber  analysis provides the view of the rides per city type and drivers per city type analysis of fare trends the recommendations. 
   
 * The number of drivers seems to increase with city classfication with rural areas having the least amount of drivers per city type and Urban areas shows more drivers. It would be beneficial to have study of population versus number of drivers needed to explore the trend.
 
 * The relationship between the number of rides and the average fare should be revisited in rural.But it's well defined in subrban and urban areas.This could be a possible of an over supply of drivers in these areas causing lower prices
 
 * Also when examining the bubble chart for urban areas . [Ride sharing Data](), it shows the smaller number of drivers do seems to have a higher average fare in general. The trend in suburban is not well defined.
 
 * Drivers in rural areas can make up 1% of the total drivers while rural areas accountfor roughly 6% of total fares and rides
City has data points for average fare well and above.

* Rural areas had less drivers and riders of Pyber ride sharing, but no well defined trend in relationship to average fare. This could possibly be explained by varying distances of rides in rural areas or the supply of drivers in rural areas. The recommendation is to perform a comparision of driver per capita may be helpful.
 
 * Overall ,  the above analysis provide insigths of trends and patterns to help CEO to take strategic decisons on the budget and performance improvements.
